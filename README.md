# Annoy Your Friends

This project is composed of 3 chat bots - Instagram, Discord & Telegram. <br>
The bots will listen for any incoming message, adressed to them directly or in a group/server they are, then, they will check if they are able to build a pun with the message content (Especially the last word of it, if text).


Yet, puns are made with and from English and French.
